# Project Description <a name="project-description"> </a>
Version 0.2.x of this project lets you create and update a list of calendars with the URL.  While limited in scope, the project provides a template and framework for version 1.x. Version 1.0 will enable you to download all the events associated with the calendar, write notes about the events, and be notified when any new events appear or existing events change.  Version 1.1 will download events from EventBrite and Meetup with criteria you specify.

# Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"> </a>
Front end:
JavaScript, HTML handlebars, BootStrap, CSS

Backend:
Postgres, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, simplecov (for code coverage)

# Planning <a name="planning"> </a>

I created the following planning docs
- [stories][stories]
- [high level story summary][stories summary]
- ERD (see [backend][backend] for more details)

I reviewed
- technical [checklist][checklist]
- requirements [requirements]

# Execution <a name="execution"> </a>
I started by following the [checklist][checklist].  I committed small increments and did testing before committing.  As issues came up (bug, different approach, specific tasks not covered by checklist), I added these to either [issues][issues] or [tasks][tasks].

For debugging, I reviewed output from the developer tool, I used console.log to follow flow and value of variables.  I also used google when not familiar with syntax or how to do something in a particular technology.

When I completed most of the [checklist][checklist], I reviewed the [requirements][requirements] and did a final round of bug testing and reviewing UI.

I then posted for review by others.
